Lumberjack
==========
Lumberjack is a rails engine to allow logging user actions with specific model and display nice message notifications.
You will be able to generate things like:

  MyUser updated his profile.
  MyUser created a new photo album. (6 minutes ago)


Installation
============
ADD A GENERATOR!!!
$ ./script/generate Lumberjack

Add the module in your model. Remember that you must have a user model and the object you're logging must belong to user. Also the user should have a name by default, but this requirement can be ignored if you customize your messages (see below).

app/models/my_model.rb

class MyModel << ActiveRecord::base
  belongs_to :user
  include Lumberjack

  // Other code here
end

By default, Lumberjack will look in your locale for [locale].lumberjack.[action], for example:

en.yml

en:
  lumberjack:
    create: "{{user_name}} created a {{class}}"
    update: "{{user_name}} updated a {{class}}"

You have only the user_name and the class of the object being created / updated available by default. see Adding specific data to the log below if you need custom fields.

Now in your view, you can retrieve a log and use the function humanize to display the message:

<% @user.logs.each do |log| %>
  <%= log.humanize -%>
<% end %>

Adding specific messages to a model
===================================
The listeners that will save your logs are going to look under the loggable_message_locale function to write your message.
By default this will be the name of the action being executed ('create', 'update').

class MyModel << ActiveRecord::base
  belongs_to :user
  include Lumberjack

  def loggable_message_locale
    'my_model.create'
  end

  // Other code here
end


so, when you create a new instance of your model, Lumberjack will look for 'lumberjack.my_model.create' in your locale:

en.yml
-
en:
  lumberjack:
    my_model:
      create: "{{user_name}} is proud to announce his new object of class {{class}}. Check it out!"

Adding specific data to the log.
================================

If you need to add data that is specific from your model you should define 'loggable_default_locale_options' and return a hash containing all the specific data you want to show (you'll have to pass user_name and class again if you need it).

class MyModel << ActiveRecord::base
  belongs_to :user
  include Lumberjack
  # Default options for the localizing of logs
  def loggable_default_locale_options
    { :user_name => user.name, :class => self.class.human_name, :quantity_of_photos => photos.size }
  end
  
  # Other code here
end

Forced logging
==============
You can always force a log creation using the UserLog class:

UserLog.create(:user => @user, :action => 'my_action', :message => 'my_model.my_action')
